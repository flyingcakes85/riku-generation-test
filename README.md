# Contribution Guidelines

* Images must have descriptive file names in the following format:

    File_Names_Are_Cool.png

* Add your images to the folder that best describes the subject matter of the book that the boy is holding. If no existing folder applies create a new one.

* All characters added must be male presenting, meaning that they are either canonically male or at least look and act like they're boys. 
    
* __No nudity__
